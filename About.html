            </div>
            <p>  Hi everyone, my full name is Nguyễn Thế Vinh, but you can call me Luke. I'm 17 years old and studying in HSGS (High School for Gifted Student). Nice to meet you!</p>
            <p>  Being a Gen Z, I believe in innovation and creation, energy and power from tech life. Coding and debating are two of my favourite hobbies as my opinion about the mutual relationship between technology and society. In addition, I prefer spending time with my family to my friends.</p>
            <p>  Painting is my hobby. In the summer time, I spent my spare time painting on computer (Paint 3D is a great tool for beginner like me). Happy to share with everyone my artwork!</p>
